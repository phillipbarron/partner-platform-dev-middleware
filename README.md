# PP Login middleware

will be some express middleware which will authenicate with partner platform and set a cookie where an app is running on local dev.

This is intended for use in applications which host child activities which are logged in by the parent.

It may be necessary to add headers too - In fact, do we need a cookie? Maybe just adding the headers will be fine
